# About Me

I first stumbled into cybersecurity by accident after leaving active duty and rejoining the Air Force Reserves in 2019 for healthcare benefits. During the time I spent in training as a 1B4, I met people in the field that shared many of my own interests, and quickly realized how much I enjoyed the discipline itself. I’ve always loved solving puzzles, and cybersecurity’s mix of problem-solving and critical thinking hooked me right away. Since then, I’ve been charging full speed down the cybersecurity path trying to learn everything I can.
