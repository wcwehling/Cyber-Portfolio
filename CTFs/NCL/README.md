My performance in NCL competitions through Cyber Skyline.

#2025 Fall - Individual Game

For my very first competition CTF, I was incredibly surprised and proud of myself for placing 233rd of 7833 in the individual game. The last two years of training, schooling, and the weeks leading up to the event feels like it's paying off, and only makes me more excited to do better in the Spring, when I plan on competing again. Unfortunately, I realized way too late that challenge coins were only offered for people who also get 80% accuracy, where I only got 58% for this game. Had I known beforehand, I would have slowed down to truly understand some of the questions that I missed only because I read through it too fast and didn't take the time to fully understand the question. I also wouldn't attempt to brute force or submit similar attempts to incorrect answers without double-checking myself. 

For this game, I was most proud of myself for completing, "The Insider (Hard)", which was a Network Traffic Analysis problem. I've always considered networking to be one of my weaker areas of cybersecurity, so the fact that I was able to figure out the path to the right answer was incredibly satisfying.
